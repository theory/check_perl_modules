Revision history for activitymail.

1.26  2009-04-09T22:29:48
      - Fixed "Illegal character in prototype for main::uri_escape" error.
        Reported by Bryce Nesbitt.
      - Moved repository to [GitHub](http://github.com/theory/activitymail).
      - Fixed a bug handling `cvs add newdir` on CVS 1.12. Per the
        [bug report](https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49403) from
        Shriram Natarajan.

1.25  2008-05-05T19:59:28
       - The URL specified by the -w option is no longer URL-encoded. Only the
         associated parameters in the GET string are. Reported by Kris Jurka.
       - Added tye "configure_requires" parameter to Build.PL.
       - Updated copyright.
       - Added link to Subversion repository.
       - Updated POD test to take better advantage of Test::Pod 1.20 or later.
       - Silenced the output of t/activitymail.t and updated it to use
         File::Spec instead of a hard-coded Unix-style path.

1.24   2006-04-04T00:30:23
       - Removed ".diff" from diff URLs, since it doesn't seem to be required
         by CVSWeb and broke ViewVC. Reported by George Pavlov.
       - Added calls to uri_escape() to properly escape URLs. Reported by
         George Pavlov.
       - Added single quotes around "%{sVv}" in all the examples of the
         comamnd-line, as it seems that some shells have a hard time
         recognizing "%{sVv}" as an argument rather than something else.
         reported by Dave Thorn.
       - Added -C option to specify a character set for use in Content-Type
         headers. Suggested by Antoine Pitrou.

1.23   2005-12-09T19:41:23
       - Various spelling corrections from Gavin Shelley.
       - Added note about incompatibility of diff on SunOS 5.9. Reported by
         Gavin Shelley.
       - Fixed CVS 1.12 command-line parsing to support the "NONE" string for
         added or deleted version numbers. Based on a patch from Remi Richard.

1.22   2005-10-04T16:57:08
       - Fixed typo spotted by Matthew Doar.
       - Fixed HTML mode so that HTML is escaped when it is inserted into the
         email (as opposed to when it is attached). reported by James B.
       - Added -P to support the new CVS 1.12 %p argument. Based on a patch
         from Remi Ricard.
       - Added the -U argument to replace spaces with underscores in file
         names before handing them off to 'diff'. Such was always done in
         earlier versions, but newer versions of CVS don't need it, so -U has
         been added for the benefit of users of older versions of CVS.

1.21   2005-02-11T02:13:00
       - Updated contact and bug reporting information.

1.20   2005-02-11T02:02:40
       - Fix for missing module name due to the way Eclipse 3.0 defines
         file locations. Patch from Greg Thompson.
       - Switched to using a code reference to reap dead children. This
         prevents error messages such as "application bug: activitymail(6644)
         has SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN but calls wait()" from appearing in the
         system log. Reported by Mike Traum.
       - Noted SVN::Notify in the "See Also" section. Check this module out if
         you need activity notification messages in Subversion.

1.19   2004-03-11T17:22:54
       - Added -q and -Q to suppress status messages. Suggested by Gary Meyer.
       - Added -E and -I to specify regular expressions to check before
         sending activity notifications for files. The regular expressions
         are compared to the names of the files being committed. Multiple
         regular expressions can be specified in a space-delimited list.
         Heavily modified patch from Gary Meyer.

1.18   2004-03-03T01:41:16
       - Slightly safer handling of directory names with spaces.
       - Changed some error messages to properly report when activitymail
         fails to open a file for reading rather than writing.
       - Added To Do section. Patches welcome.

1.17   2004-03-03T00:55:30
       - Better handling of file names and directory names with spaces in
         them. This broke when I added support for directory names with spaces
         in 1.16, since it eliminated support for file names with spaces. This
         version correctly supports both. Reported by contact@abilsoft.com.

1.16   Tue Oct 28 05:22:23 2003
       - Now only adding the version arguments to the CVSWeb diff URL if V has
         been specified. This makes it easier to use activitymail in
         environments where the CVSWeb server's checkout isn't fully
         up-to-date, such as at SourceForge. Suggested by Brad Clarke.
       - Removed --minimal option from default value off the -o option, which
         is a list of options to be passed through to diff. This is for
         reasons of performance (see the diff man page for more on this). The
         default value of -o is now simply "-u".
       - Added support for directory names with spaces and commas. Reported by
         Colin Gray.
       - Removed discussion of forking from the known issues section. It seems
         to work just fine the way it is.

1.15   Wed Oct  8 18:00:32 2003
       - Branch tag information is now also included for commit messages sent
         without diffs. Thanks to Bob Bradley for the fix.

1.14   Wed Sep 10 05:29:14 2003
       - Added support for file names with spaces. CVS has a bug that prevents
         it from properly diffing when it is passed arguments to be passed to
         diff with spaces in them. Since we use the -L option to diff to pass
         in the complete file name to be put into the diff headers, this can
         lead to problems. So until CVS fixes this bug, any files with spaces
         in them will actually have their diff header file names with
         underscores substituted for spaces. Inspired by a hacked version of
         activitymail sent in by David Krembs.
       - Added support for files with commas in them.
       - Now require Perl 5.005 or later in order to use regular expression
         objects.

1.13   Tue Sep  9 21:18:43 2003
       - Full directory name to files within the repository is now correctly
         included in the diff headers. In 1.12, only the last directory in
         the full directory path was included.
       - Made all HTML emails complete HTML messages, complete with DOCTYPE
         declaration.

1.12   Mon Sep  8 17:57:50 2003
       - Documented -V option. Thanks to Hernan Otero for the spot.
       - Fixed file names in diffs against /dev/null so that they're properly
         displayed in the diff headers.
       - Removed a few superfluous commas from the diff shell commands.
       - File names in diff headers are now full paths from the repository
         root. This change should make it possible to actually apply the diff
         from the root by simply doing `patch -p0 < activitymail.patch`.
       - Added -N option to specify the location of the null file. Will be
         useful on those systems that don't have /dev/null (e.g., Win32).

1.11   Fri Aug 29 16:53:25 2003
       - Updated information and links to other CVS notification applications.
       - Simple status messages (new directories, imports) and syncmail mode
         once again send email message bodies.
       - Simple status messages and syncmail mode now send HTML email if
         the -H option has been passed.

1.10   Wed Aug 27 23:25:21 2003
       - Added empty lines between the text of the commit message and the
         attached diff. This looks neater in mail clients that display
         attachments inline.
       - Added -H option sending HTML email. Thanks to Hernan Otero for
         the initial implementation.
       - Added -V option to include revision numbers after each listed file.
         Thanks to Hernan Otero for the initial implementation.
       - Cut down on the number of times that data is copied in the script,
         thus reducing processing time and memory requirements, especially
         on big commits.
       - Added -w option for a link to a CVSWeb view of the diff for each
         changed file. Actually looks best when used with HTML. Thanks to
         Hernan Otero for the initial implementation.
       - Added check for binary files so that they won't be diffed.
       - Added -B option to specify a list of binary file name extensions
         to indicate files that should not be diffed.
       - New files and deleted files are now diffed against /dev/null in
         order to provide a more realistic diff.
       - Added -j option to point to a diff executable to compare added and
         deleted files. Defaults to "diff", assuming that it's in the path.
       - Added -M option to prevent messages over a maximum size from being
         emailed. Thanks to Sam Tregar.
       - Added -S option to add directory context information to the subject.
         Thanks to Kent Lindquist.
       - Branch tags are now listed in the email under their own header.
         Suggested by David Krembs.
       - Added -v option to print the version number.
       - Added POD tests.
       - Switched to Module::Build for installation.

1.04   2002-11-10 22:58:36
       - Turned off output buffering, which will hopefully allow status
         messages to be printed as they happen.
       - Added "X-Mailer" header to mail messages, so that people who see
         activitymail messages in archives and such and want to know how
         they were created will be able to find activitymail.

1.03   2002-08-05 18:34:51
       - Added -e option so that the cvs executable can be specified.
       - Added -u option to specify the From header of email messages.
       - Added -g option to use $USER environment variable for grouping
         commit transactions. Useful for connecting via :pserver:, where
         grouping via pgrp won't work. Thanks to Derek Scherger for suggesting
         these last three changes.
       - Added "Bugs" section to documentation with a link to the CPAN Request
         Tracker
       - Changed example domains in documentation to "example.com".

1.02   2002-06-30 19:16:03
       - Fixed problem with global filehandles getting closed in the wrong
         places, thanks to Scott Lanning.
       - Created distribution package so that activitymail can be properly
         installed on a system.

1.01   2002-05-22 20:58:41
       - Added -o option so that diff options can be passed through to diff.
       - Untabified and rewraped source code.
       - Updated documentation and corrected typos.

1.00   2002-04-08 23:47:51
       - Fixed issues with precidence opening files and such, with thanks to
         Sam Tregar.
      
0.99   2002-01-22 00:07:12
       - Changed transfer encoding from quoted-printable to 8bit, with thanks
         to Sam Tregar.
      
0.987  2002-01-20 16:05:54
       - Added MIME-Version header, with thanks to Sam Tregar.
       - Documented issues with forking.

0.986  2002-01-11 19:09:58
       - Renamed tmp_file_basename() to tmp_base_name().
       - Updated comments and ranamed tmp_file_only().
       - Removed debugging. No more glob()!
       - Initial release to the CPAN.
